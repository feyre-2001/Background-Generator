# Background-Generator
- This is a fun project of my days when I started to learn Javascript. This creates nice awesome gradients for our backgrounds. 
- You can give two inputs using the color picker and it gives out the code for the gradient background so you can copy and paste it tou your HTML site and have a fun background!
